**Goals:**

- ✅ Use Bootstrap 5 as the base layout \& grid
- ✅ Remix components into **non‑generic**, neo‑brutalist layouts
- ✅ Focus on typography, motion, and strong visual hierarchy
- ✅ Keep everything responsive and production‑ready

## ⚙️ Design \& Development Process

1. 🎨 Defined aesthetic: **neo‑brutalist education platform** (CODEX LABS)
2. 🔡 Chose type \& color system away from common “AI slop” choices

4. ✏️ Designed hero, cards, and sections with custom CSS (no default components look)
5. ⚡ Implemented JS for:
    - Filters (courses \& blog)
    - Form validation \& UI feedback
    - Scroll animations and parallax shapes
    - Keyboard shortcuts + fun easter eggs
6. 🧪 Manually tested across viewport sizes and common browsers
7. 🚀 Deployed via GitHub Pages
